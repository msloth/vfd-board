vfd-board
=========

Drivers and example to use a board with a VFD display, driven by Motorola M66004SP

# update

This project is abandoned as the hardware is likely to be broken and considering this was one-of-a-kind rescue operation of thrown away scrap, I'm unlikely to acquire such hw again. Ergo, this will most likely not be worked on further.

Status at abandon-time: the shift-register stuff was working - I could read out what buttons were pressed, but the VFD-display never showed any sign of life.
